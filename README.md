# Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio site. It is built with React and the components are styled with DaisyUI. It showcases my skill set, projects, and offers insight into who I am.
 
# Structure 

## What I Learned
- Built a responsive web application using React. It can be diffcult.
- Implemented components styled with DaisyUI for a visually appealing design.This was a great learning experience. I feel that DaisyUI had good styled components to add. The documentation was easy to understand and implement alongside TailwindCSS. If you are going use TailwindCSS in project, I would definitely recommend DaisyUI as it gives your web a clean look.

            I am a hard worker and enjoy a challenge. I am self-motivated and
            enjoy working as part of a team. I am looking forward to starting my
            career in tech.
           
              <h3>Why Tech?</h3>
              After working in education, I found tech to be an exciting career
              that allows you to help others and challenge yourself. which is a
              great appeal to me.
